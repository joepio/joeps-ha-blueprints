## [Hue Motion Sensor Lights (zigbee2mqtt)](/motion-light.yml)

Controls a light (or lights) using a Philips Hue SML001 motion sensor connected to Home Assistant via Zigbee2MQTT.

- Turns on lights when occupancy is detected and off when unoccupied.
- Uses different brightness settings for day and night.
- Optionally, disables motion-based activation if a media player (e.g., TV) is on.
- Allows user-configurable fade-in and fade-out times for smooth lighting effects.
